Problem Statement:

You have to write an example code to demonstrate the same concept of data preparation
and searching. It could be any dataset, any scenario, any use-case, as per your
imagination.

It covers the following points:

Merging data from multiple data sources.
Performing memory efficient searching with Global Secondary Index.
Re Structioring of data.

To run the code:
Cloce the github repository in your computer. git clone https://github.com/Electric-Grasshopper/Data-analysis-on-incoming-streams.git
Run dataPreperation.ipynb file which will create two json files in dataStore folder.
Run DataBaseSearch.ipynb file to search for movie titles across the newly created data store.
That's it.
